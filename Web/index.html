<h1>Feeds for TYPO3 CMS</h1>

<p>
	As experimentation, a Theme Manager for TYPO3 is under development and can be installed from <br />
	<a href="https://github.com/typo3-themes/theme_manager">this repository</a>. Once installed, the Theme Manager will <br/>
	consume	a data source containing a set of themes to be installed in TYPO3 CMS. The feed containing the repository can <br/> bee
	seen here <a href="feed/typo3cms/v1/repositories.json">repositories.json</a>.
